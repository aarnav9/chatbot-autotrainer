Benchmarks












As part of the campus Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy, undegraduates are expected to make satisfactory completion of benchmark requirements. Highlights of the Policy are below.


Full-time degree-seeking students are expected to graduate in four years.


Students are expected to create and update a 
four year plan
 towards graduation.


Students are expected to successfully pass important benchmark courses by certain semesters to ensure they are on track to graduate in a timely fashion.


The exact benchmark courses and timeframe for completion vary by 
major
.


Students who do not successfully pass benchmark requirements risk being dismissed from their major.


Students with questions about benchmark requirements should contact their academic advisor.
